# random sample

To draw the samples **income.sample( )** is used to draw random samples from the dataset containing all the columns. Here n = 5 depicts we need 5 columns and **frac = 0.1** tells that we need 10 percent of the data as my sample.

```
income.sample(n = 5)
income.sample(frac = 0.1)
```
